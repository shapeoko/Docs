The V-Wheels and Makerslide work together to hold components of the machine in alignment and allow them to move only along an axis (linear motion). When assembling the wheels, a precision washer (1mm thick) goes between the bearings. The precision washers are specced to be 1mm thick and provide a surface for the races to contact, keeping everything tight. 

The belts which the stepper motors drive the X- and Y-axes  require smooth idlers to route the belts so that they are held against the pulleys on the motor shafts.

Please check your wheels after assembly to be certain that they work smoothly and that the bearings stay aligned. If you have any difficulties, check that the plate is flat, and that the washers are okay. If necessary, take the V-wheel apart and check that the bearing is seated all the way in and that there is no debris between the outer race of the bearing and the lip inside the V-wheel, because that could cause the bearing to twist (and seize) as the bolt was tightened. Sometimes, a bearing will get two rubber shields on one face -- check for that too.[1](http://www.shapeoko.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3868&p=29096)

###Requirements

####Parts

1. 25202-01 Delrin **V-Wheels** x 20pcs
* 25196-01 5x16x5mm **Bearings** x 40pcs
* 25201-01 **Precision (Shim) Washers** x 20pcs

####Tools

* One M5 x 20mm (or longer) Button Head Cap Screw (BHCS) to align the pieces during assembly

###Assemble all of the V-Wheels (20 wheels total)
1. Take one bearing (**\#2**), and insert it into the Delrin V-Wheel (**\#1**)
2. Using one of the M5 BHCS, slide the wheel over the screw
3. Slide a single precision washer (**\#3**) over the screw, down onto the bearing
4. Slide another bearing around the screw
5. Squeeze the assembly together --- you can use your thumbs, a tool such as an arbor press, or you can add a washer and a nut to the bolt and tighten using a hex key and wrench. There will be a bit of friction getting the bearings settled into the wheel. These are force fit tolerances so you might have to push hard. When you tighten the wheel to the plate, you will squeeze the entire thing together tightly. 
6. Repeat this procedure for the remaining V-Wheels (20 total)

**Note:** You may want to consider marking the precision washers with a marker. If you run in to problems, the M5 Flat Washers and these precision washers are almost indistinguishable and very easy to mix up. If you mark them from the start, this shouldn't happen.

The precision washer in the wheel assemblies may get off-center while storing them --- if this happens, use a small tool to re-center them.

Assembled, these make up **25203-02**.

Alternate, assembly-line procedure for the V-Wheels:

1. Arrange all the pieces on a stable, flat work surface
2. Place one bearing into each V-Wheel 
3. Place a V-Wheel bearing side down onto the longest M5 bolt which is available, add a precision shim, then another bearing, press things together --- repeat until the bolt is full, clear the bolt and repeat until done

###Requirements

####Parts

1. 25196-01 5x16x5mm **Bearings** x 12pcs
* 25201-01 **Precision (Shim) Washers** x 6pcs
* 25197-01 **Smooth Idler Wheel (Drum)** x 6pcs

####Tools

* One M5 x 20mm (or longer) Button Head Cap Screw (BHCS) to align the pieces during assembly

###Assemble all of the smooth idlers (6 idlers total)

1. Take one bearing (**\#1**), and insert it into the open end of the smooth idler (**\#3**)
2. Using one of the M5 BHCS, slide the idler over the screw
3. Slide a single precision washer (**\#2**) over the screw, down onto the bearing
4. Slide another bearing around the screw
5. Squeeze the assembly together --- you can use your thumbs, a tool such as an arbor press, or you can add a washer and a nut to the bolt and tighten using a hex key and wrench. A small portion of the second bearing will be protruding from the edge of the smooth idler. This is normal. We will tighten the entire assembly when the idlers gets bolted to the motor mount plate (the bearing will still show at the side facing the plate).
6. Repeat this procedure for the remaining smooth idlers (6 total)
