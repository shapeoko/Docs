# End Plates

##Y-Axis Rail Assembly (PS20026)

**Note:** The two pieces of MakerSlide used in the following steps must have threads in them, cut by tapping. If you have not yet finished tapping your MakerSlide, you can put this off no longer.

Slide two Belt Clip Anchor Assemblies (**\#4**) into the top slot of the MakerSlide (**\#5**).

Attach one end plate (**\#1**) to each piece of MakerSlide using the 12mm M5 bolts (**\#2**) and M5 washers (**\#3**). Place what will be the top of each piece of Makerslide at the top of the channel --- the top of the MakerSlide should flush with the bottom of the horizontal slot (the two assemblies will have a slight mirror-imaged asymmetry).

Do not attach the second end plate, that will be done in the next step.
